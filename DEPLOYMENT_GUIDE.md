# üöÄ Deployment Guide for Zerodha Trading App

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Why You Need Web Hosting

**Zerodha's KiteConnect API requires a publicly accessible HTTPS URL for OAuth redirects.**

‚ùå **What WON'T work:**
- `file://` URLs (local files)
- `localhost` URLs
- HTTP URLs (must be HTTPS)
- Private/internal network URLs

‚úÖ **What WILL work:**
- Any publicly accessible HTTPS website
- Free hosting services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel
- Your own web server with SSL certificate

- ‚úÖ Verify redirect URL is working

**4. Files Not Loading**
